#Compound Interest Calculator

This is a simple script that calculates the compound interest using principal, annual interest rate, periods, and monthly deposit. It also exports the result to a CSV file and plots the result using matplotlib.

##Prerequisites
The following libraries are required to run this script:

*Tkinter
*Matplotlib
*Pandas
You can install the libraries by running the following command:

*pip install -r requirements.txt

##Running the script
To run the script, simply execute the main.py file:

*python main.py

This will open a Tkinter GUI where you can input the principal, annual interest rate, periods, and monthly deposit. Then click on the "Calculate" button to calculate the compound interest and display the result in the form of a plot and a table.

##Using the script
Input the Principal, Annual Interest Rate, Periods and Monthly Deposit in the Tkinter GUI
Click on the "Calculate" button to calculate the compound interest.
The result will be displayed in the form of a plot and a table.
The result will be also exported to a CSV file named "compoundInterest.csv" in the same folder as the script.
##Notes
The script is using Python version 3.
The script is tested on MacOS and Windows.
In case of any problems or bug, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.
